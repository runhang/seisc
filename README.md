# Seisc
Format Conversion Tool for Seismic Files(.evt).


I decided to open source this c++ code, which converts binary files to txt format based on the console program. Although this code is compiled based on Visual Studio 2015, the library files that depend on it are all from the standard library. I think it can be run on Linux.
